- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?


I like it a lot actually; it helps me kind of see the patterns and think about what code I already have and just what I need to add for the specific classes needs. 


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
everything worked for the most part except for minor bugs like missing brackets and such. And I kept forgetting to initialize in the constructors and the main reason it wouldn't run was because I didn't implement the requirements for each class. I would say for students taking the course in the future is to give yourself time because at first I was like I'm going to fail since I don't know the syntax of java but as time goes on and practiceing and listening to what Ab and Jordan say in class, you end up getting the hang of most of it.
